# Opps_CPP

## Overview
This repository contains C++ programs demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each program is a standalone example of concepts like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Dynamic Binding.

## Programs
- **Abstraction.cpp**: Illustrates the concept of abstraction in OOP.
- **Encapsulation.cpp**: Demonstrates how data hiding can be achieved through encapsulation.
- **Inheritance.cpp**: Shows an example of how new classes can be created based on existing classes.
- **Polymorphism.cpp**: Provides a clear example of polymorphism in action.
- **Dynamic_Binding.cpp**: Explains dynamic binding using virtual functions.

## Getting Started
To run these programs, you will need a C++ compiler. Clone the repository, navigate to the program you want to run, and compile it using your C++ compiler.

```bash
g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
./program_name
